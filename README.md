    <h1>Privacy Policy for World Wide Weather Apps</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: [25/11/2024]</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>At Gaurav Pathak Developers, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our app, World Wide Weather Apps.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly provided by you. However, our app may collect the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> To provide accurate weather updates, our app collects your location in two ways:
            <ul>
                <li>Device Location: Using GPS or network-based location services.</li>
                <li>City Search: When you type a city name, the app fetches weather data for the searched location.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information (e.g., OS version) to improve app performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Data:</strong> Internet connectivity status to fetch live weather updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your data only to provide the following services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To show weather information for your current location or any searched city worldwide.</li>
        <li>To improve the user experience and app functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third-party advertisers. However, we may share non-personal data with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Weather API Providers: For fetching accurate weather information based on your location or searched city.</li>
        <li>Analytics Tools: To improve app performance (e.g., Google Analytics).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p><strong>Real-Time Data Use:</strong> Location data (from device or city search) is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Stop Sharing Location:</strong> You can revoke location access permissions or disable GPS in your device settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Instant Deletion:</strong> We ensure that your data is deleted immediately after it is used to provide weather updates. We do not retain your personal information beyond the time necessary to fulfill its purpose.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>As a user, you have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request details of the data we process.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can revoke permissions or delete any cached data by clearing the app's storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize your data security and implement industry-standard measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or misuse. Your data is not stored for long periods and is deleted once it is no longer required for processing.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Usage for Speech Recognition</h2>
    <p>If our app records audio (for example, using voice commands or speech recognition), rest assured that we only use the audio data for its intended purpose (e.g., weather updates based on voice input). We do not store, sell, or misuse your recorded voice data. The recorded audio is used temporarily and is deleted immediately after processing. Your privacy is our priority, and we ensure that your voice data is never used for any malicious or unauthorized purposes.</p>
